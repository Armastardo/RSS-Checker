# RSS-Checker
Check a RSS Feed every given time for a specific update.

This program was built using Python 3.6.5. In order to run it on your own machine, you'll need to install PyQt5 and feedparser too.
## Usage
*Copy the RSS feed that you wan't to read on the first box.
*Write what you're looking for on the second box. You can include a number at the end. Ex: "Grand Blue 01".
*Select an interval of time to check the RSS.
*Click on Check button and leave it in the background. Once it catches a release with your input, a warning will appear.

Feel free to modify or request any feature that you'll like to see.
